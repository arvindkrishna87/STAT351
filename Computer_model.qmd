# Computer model

Assume that the true computer model is the following:

```{r}
curve(1/(1+x^2), from=-4, to=4, ylim=c(-.7,1))
```

We will consider potential methods to replace the computer model above with a meatamodel or a surrogate model.

## Polynomial interpolation

Below is an example of a $7$-point polynomial interpolator.

```{r}
x=seq(-4,4,length=7)
y=1/(1+x^2)
X=as.matrix(cbind(1,x,x^2,x^3,x^4,x^5,x^6))
a=solve(X,y)
a
u=seq(-4,4,length=100)
yhat=u
for(i in 1:100)
  yhat[i]=sum(c(1,u[i],u[i]^2,u[i]^3,u[i]^4,u[i]^5,u[i]^6)*a)
lines(u,yhat, col=2, lty=2, lwd = 2)
points(x,y,col=2)
```

Notice that the polynomial interpolation model tends to be unstable near the edges, this is called Runge's phenomenon.
