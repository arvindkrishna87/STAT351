    "section": "1.4 Getting started with code",
    "text": "1.4 Getting started with code\n\n1.4.1 Reading data\nSuppose you want to work with the data from Problem 19 of Chapter 1, which is in a file named CH01PR19.txt which you have saved from the CD or the course web page in the Datasets folder within your R working directory. Assume the file has no header. You will want to create a Table object in R containing this data. First choose an appropriate name for the table. Assume you choose to name it Data. Then, you can execute the following code :\n\nData &lt;- read.table(\"./Datasets/CH01PR19.txt\")\n\nThen there will be a Table object in R named Data containing the data in rows and columns. To view it, you would type\n\nData\n\nHowever, if it is a large file, you might not be able to view the whole table at once. In that case, you may use the head() function, which will display only the first 6 rows of Data:\n\nhead(Data)\n\n     V1 V2\n1 3.897 21\n2 3.885 14\n3 3.778 28\n4 2.540 22\n5 3.028 21\n6 3.865 31\n\n\nNote that, in the absence of a header, the columns will be named V1, V2, etc., and the rows will be numbered.\nNow if the file does have a header (which you may have added yourself), you need to change the above command to:\n\nData &lt;- read.table(\"CH01PR19.txt\", header=TRUE)\n\nIn this case, when you view the file you will see the title for each column at the top of each column instead of V1, V2, etc. R regards these titles as names for the columns, and not as data.\nIf you want to load the data file from some other directory, you need to type the full path name in the read.table() command. For instance,\n\nData &lt;- read.table(file=\"C:/stat350/CH01PR19.txt\", header=FALSE) \n\nYou may read data manually as well. Here both Return and New are vectors.\n\nReturn &lt;- c(74,66,81,52,73,62,52,45,62,46,60,46,38)\nNew &lt;-c(5,6,8,11,12,15,16,17,18,18,19,20,20)\n\n\n\n1.4.2 Renaming columns\nNow suppose the file Data has two columns, and the first column is the GPA, while the second column is ACT score. If you would like to rename the columns in your R data table so that each column has a descriptive title, you could give the R command:\n\nnames(Data) &lt;- c(\"GPA\", \"ACT\")\n\nThen when you view the file the titles of the columns will have the new names you assigned:\n\nhead(Data)\n\n    GPA ACT\n1 3.897  21\n2 3.885  14\n3 3.778  28\n4 2.540  22\n5 3.028  21\n6 3.865  31\n\n\nNote that you can also give the columns these titles in the data file before you load it into R, and then use the header = TRUE setting when loading. Also, to avoid errors, you should never include a space in the title of any column\n\n\n1.4.3 Exporting data\nSuppose you wish to export Data to file Intro.csv in your folder.\n\nwrite.table(Data, \"C:/stat350/Intro.csv\", col.names=TRUE, sep=\",\")\n\nSuppose you wish to export Data to Intro.txt with a tab delimiter:\n\nwrite.table(Data, \"C:/stat350/Intro.txt\", col.names=TRUE, sep=\"\\t\")\n\nYou may export R objects to other file types in a similar manner.\n\n\n1.4.4 R environment\nIf you want to see which R objects are currently in your R environment, you can type:\n\nls()\n\nYou may also see these objects at the top right corner of the R Studio interface.\nIf you no longer need one or more of these objects, you can remove them. For instance, if you are done with Data, you can type:\n\nrm(Data)\n\nThen Data will no longer be in your current R environment. When you quit R, if you wish to keep all the new objects in your current R environment, be sure to answer Yes when asked, Save workspace image?\n\n\n1.4.5 Scatter plots and simple linear regression\nSuppose the data for Problem 19 of Chapter One has been stored in an R object named Data which has two columns, the first column named GPA and the second column named ACT. You want to make a scatterplot in R with ACT scores on the horizontal axis and GPA on the vertical axis. The R command is:\n\nplot(Data$ACT, Data$GPA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the dollar sign is used to reference either column in the table named Data. The first argument to the plot() function is the column corresponding to the variable associated with the horizontal axis, and the second argument is the column corresponding to the variable associated with the vertical axis. Alternately, you could define two new vector variables, X and Y, to hold the data of the individual columns, and use these vectors as the arguments to the plot() function:\n\nX &lt;- Data$ACT\nY &lt;- Data$GPA\nplot(X, Y)\n\nFor now we will stick with the former approach. The resulting plot appears in the R Graphics Device within the R interface. Click on it to view it, save it, print it, etc.\nNote that whenever you make a new plot the old one will disappear (this can be changed; but not easily), so save it if you don’t want to lose it. However, the current scatterplot is inadequate. It has no title, the axis labels aren’t very informative, and the points are open circles rather than dark filled-in circles. To fix this, we can add some additional settings to the plot() command:\n\nplot(Data$ACT, Data$GPA, main=\"Problem 1.19\", xlab=\"ACT Test Score\", ylab=\"Freshman GPA\", pch=19)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we obtain a much nicer scatterplot.\nWhatever you put in quotes after main = will be the title for the plot. Whatever you put in quotes after xlab = and ylab = will the the labels for the horizontal and vertical axes, respectively. The number after pch = is a code for the symbol to use for the points. You can try other numbers from 1 to 25. You can also use any symbol on your keyboard for the points, including numerals and letters, using quotes. For instance, if you want to use an asterisk for the points, type pch=\"*\".\nYou may want to also add a plot of the estimated regression function to the scatterplot of the data. This assumes you have already obtained the least squares estimates of the regression coefficients (see “Simple Linear Regression in R”).\n\nfit &lt;- lm(Data$GPA ~ Data$ACT)\nfit &lt;- lm(GPA~ACT, data=Data)   # another option\nplot(Data$ACT, Data$GPA, main=\"Problem 1.19\", xlab=\"ACT Test Score\", ylab=\"Freshman GPA\", pch=19)\nabline(fit, col = \"red\", lwd = 2) #lwd is for line-width\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe line will appear superimposed over the data. You can also just type the actual values for the estimated intercept and slope if you prefer.\nYou may also use ggplot2 to make plots if you wish. ggplot() has a more intuitive syntax as it is based on the Grammar of Graphics, and also has more comprehensive formatting options.\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nggplot(Data, aes(x = ACT, y = GPA))+\n  geom_point()+\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  labs(\n    title = \"Problem 1.19\"\n  )\n\n$title\n[1] \"Problem 1.19\"\n\nattr(,\"class\")\n[1] \"labels\"\n\n\nTo save your plot, click anywhere on the plot, then on the menu bar choose File, then Save as. Choose the format in which you want to save the plot, then where you want to save it on your drive.\nCheck the estimates for the intercept and slope:\n\nfit\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = GPA ~ ACT, data = Data)\n\nCoefficients:\n(Intercept)          ACT  \n    2.11405      0.03883  \n\n\nCompute fitted values:\n\nfit$fitted.values \n\nCompute residuals:\n\nfit$residuals\n\nCompute the estimate of \\(\\sigma^2\\), that is, the MSE:\n\nn &lt;- dim(Data)[1]\nsum(fit$residuals^2)/(n-2)\n\n[1] 0.3882848",

Type 1 error rate will be higher for a Student’s t-test, particularly if one of the samples has a relatively higher variance, and a smaller sample size as compared to the other sample.\nThe functions t.test() and power.t.test() can be used to conveniently test the hypothesis, estimate confidence intervals, estimate power of the test, or the observations needed for a certain power of the test. Look at the documentation of these function, by executing the code ?t.test() or ?power.t.test() in the R console, to see the parameters you need to specify for using them.",

    "text": "Q1\nWCAS (Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences) is considering replacing keyboards used in offices of all its departments with new keyboards of a different brand. Let the current keyboard be denoted as A, and the new one denoted as B, where A and B can be assumed to be the brands of the keyboards. However, before making the purchase, WCAS is conducting an experiment to test if the new keyboard will increase the typing efficiency.\nFor the experiments mentioned in all the questions below, assume that:\n\nThe manuscripts used in the replications of the experiments are not the same, but are of a fixed length and font size.\nThe effect of typist on the typing time can be considered as a random variable with constant variance, and thus can be combined with the random error due to unknown factors. Typists within the same department as as similar as typists across departments.\nThe effect of manuscript on the typing time can be considered as a random variable. However, manuscripts within the same department are similar, while manuscripts across departments are relatively less similar.\nThe typing time is modeled as:\n\n\\(y = \\mu_{keyboard} + \\beta_{script} + \\epsilon\\),\nwhere the effect of the keyboards is fixed, and the effect of the script is a random variable, whose variance will be higher if scripts from across multiple departments are used as compared to the case if scripts from within the same department are used in the experiment. However, a given script will have the same effect on the typing time if used multiple times in an experiment.\n\nQ1(a)\nThe first experiment is conducted as follows.\n16 manuscripts are distributed randomly among 16 different typists - one manuscript to each typist. The manuscripts are chosen randomly from different departments of WCAS. 8 typists are randomly selected to use keyboard A and the rest use keyboard B.\nThe times taken (in minutes) by the typists for the 2 keyboards are:\n\n\n\nKeyboard A\nKeyboard B\n\n\n\n\n8.73\n10.77\n\n\n11.31\n8.33\n\n\n9.15\n11.87\n\n\n13.78\n8.31\n\n\n11.58\n7.28\n\n\n9.14\n4.99\n\n\n11.05\n12.61\n\n\n9.49\n8.81\n\n\n\nIs there evidence to support the claim that the time taken by keyboard B is less than that by keyboard A?\nState the null and alternate hypothesis, compute the test statistic, conduct the test, and state the conclusion.\n(4 points)\n\na &lt;- c(8.73, 11.31,  9.15, 13.78, 11.58, 9.14, 11.05,  9.49)\nb &lt;- c(10.77,  8.33, 11.87,  8.31,  7.28,  4.99, 12.61,  8.81)\n\n\n\nQ1(b)\nThe company that sells keyboards of brand B contested the conclusions made based on the above test, and asked WCAS to conduct another experiment, where the same script is tested on both the keyboards, and the typing times are compared for the same script across keyboards.\nWCAS randomly distributed 8 scripts among 16 typists, where each script was shared by two typists - one of them typed it with keyboard A, and the other one typed the same script with keyboard B.\nThe times taken (in minutes) by the typists for the 2 keyboards are in the table below. Each row of the table shows time taken to type the same script.\n\n\n\nKeyboard A\nKeyboard B\n\n\n\n\n9.13\n7.58\n\n\n10.31\n9.11\n\n\n6.95\n8.02\n\n\n12.77\n12.75\n\n\n10.26\n8.97\n\n\n8.3\n6.65\n\n\n12.07\n10.34\n\n\n12.24\n11.24\n\n\n\nIs there evidence to support the claim that the time taken by keyboard B is less than that by keyboard A?\nState the null and alternate hypothesis, compute the test statistic, conduct the test, and state the conclusion.\n(4 points)\n\na &lt;- c(9.13, 10.31,  6.95, 12.77, 10.26,  8.3, 12.07, 12.24)\nb &lt;- c(7.58,  9.11,  8.02, 12.75,  8.97,  6.65, 10.34, 11.24)\n\n\n\nQ1(c)\nWere the conclusions based on the experiments in 1(a) different from the experiments in 1(b)? If yes, then why? If no, then why not? Explain in terms of design principles.\n(4 points)\n\n\nQ1(d)\nUnconvinced by the results of the tests in 1(a) and 1(b), WCAS asked the Department of Statistics and Data Science (DSDS) to conduct both types of experiments (1(a) & 1(b)) again.\nDSDS conducted experiments similar to the ones conducted in 1(a) and 1(b). However, they distributed the scripts available within their own department to typists. Note that the scripts within the same department will be similar as compared to scripts across departments.\nFor the first experiment, DSDS randomly distributed 16 scripts among 16 typists - one manuscript to each typist. The typists and manuscripts are chosen randomly from within DSDS. 8 typists are randomly selected to use keyboard A and the rest use keyboard B.\nThe times taken (in minutes) by the typists for the 2 keyboards are:\n\n\n\nKeyboard A\nKeyboard B\n\n\n\n\n10.79\n9.20\n\n\n10.05\n6.53\n\n\n11.17\n9.52\n\n\n10.32\n8.50\n\n\n12.08\n9.75\n\n\n8.81\n9.18\n\n\n11.66\n9.92\n\n\n11.93\n9.09\n\n\n\nIs there evidence to support the claim that the time taken by keyboard B is less than that by keyboard A?\nState the null and alternate hypothesis, compute the test statistic, conduct the test, and state the conclusion.\n(4 points)\n\na &lt;- c(10.79, 10.05, 11.17, 10.32, 12.08,  8.81, 11.66, 11.93)\nb &lt;- c(9.20, 6.53, 9.52, 8.50, 9.75, 9.18, 9.92, 9.09)\n\n\n\nQ1(e)\nAre the conclusions based on the experiment conducted by DSDS in 1(d) the same as that of the experiment conducted in 1(a)?\nWhat do you think can be the reason of the conclusions being the same (if they are indeed the same) or different (if they are indeed different)?\n(4 points)\n\n\nQ1(f)\nFor the seconds experiment, DSDS randomly distributed 8 scripts among 16 typists, where each script was shared by two typists - one of them typed it with keyboard A, and the other one typed the same script with keyboard B.\nThe times taken (in minutes) by the typists for the 2 keyboards are in the table below. Each row of the table shows time taken to type the same script.\n\n\n\nKeyboard A\nKeyboard B\n\n\n\n\n10.99\n8.53\n\n\n9.73\n7.06\n\n\n9.38\n8.32\n\n\n9.29\n10.79\n\n\n8.26\n9.61\n\n\n9.11\n11.00\n\n\n9.51\n8.76\n\n\n9.73\n8.88\n\n\n\nIs there evidence to support the claim that the time taken by keyboard B is less than that by keyboard A?\nState the null and alternate hypothesis, compute the test statistic, conduct the test, and state the conclusion.\n(4 points)\n\na &lt;- c(10.99,  9.73,  9.38,  9.29,  8.26,  9.11,  9.51,  9.73)\nb &lt;- c(8.53,  7.06,  8.32, 10.79, 9.61, 11.00,  8.76,  8.88)\n\n\n\nQ1(g)\nAre the conclusions based on the experiment conducted by DSDS in 1(f) the same as that of the experiment conducted in 1(b)?\nWhat do you think can be the reason of the conclusions being the same (if they are indeed the same) or different (if they are indeed different)?\n(4 points)\n\n\nQ1(h)\nIf the true difference between the mean typing time with the 2 keyboards is 60 seconds, compute the power of the test for each of the 4 tests - 1(a), 1(b), 1(d), and 1(f). You can assume the population variances to be the same for the populations considered in each experiment.\n(8 points)\n\n\nQ1(i)\nWhich test among 1(a), 1(b), 1(d), and 1(f) would you recommend in the future for a similar problem? Why?\nIs there any potential disadvantage of the recommended test?\n(4 points)\n\n\nQ1(j)\nDesign an experiment that uses minimum resources (i.e., minimum replicates) to provide a power of at least 95% in detecting a potential difference of 60 seconds in the typing time taken by the keyboards.

Don’t plug-in any values in the expression, leave the expression in an algebraic form.\n(12 points)\n\n\nQ4(c)\nSuppose engineers have modified the oven manufacturing process in the factory to minimize the temperature variation between ovens. The quality testing team has to design an experiment to test the hypothesis test in 4(a) again. They decide to conduct the experiment on a random sample of 3 ovens manufactured based on the new process in the factory.\nAssume that the budget for the total number of replicates (successive heat measurements on all ovens) in the experiment is fixed as \\(N\\). Derive the optimal number of replicates for each oven to maximize the power of the test.\nYou may use the following result.\nThe solution of the problem,\n\\(\\min \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2\\), subject to \\(\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i = C\\), where \\(C\\) is a constant, is:\n\\(x_i = C/n\\)\n(2 points)\n\n\nQ5\nSuppose that experiments are being conducted to analyse the effect of whey protein and creatine (supplement) on growth in muscle mass. The table below show the muscle mass growth (in grams/100 kg body weight) of a randomly selected sample of 32 individuals in a month. Each individual took a different amount of protein (0.4, 0.6, 0.8, or 1.0 grams/kg body weight) and either took the supplement or didn’t take it.\n\n\n\nSupplement\nProtein amount\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.4g\n0.6g\n0.8g\n1.0g\n\n\nCreatine\n105.7\n419.2\n608.4\n623.1\n\n\nCreatine\n111.6\n418.4\n602.9\n602.9\n\n\nCreatine\n90.8\n435.3\n591.2\n581.5\n\n\nCreatine\n92.6\n424.2\n589.4\n594.4\n\n\nNone\n104.9\n452.1\n416.0\n366.8\n\n\nNone\n93.5\n447.3\n400.6\n383.3\n\n\nNone\n103.2\n466.4\n407.7\n369.1\n\n\nNone\n109.0\n449.6\n405.9\n370.1\n\n\n\n\n\nQ5(a)\nAnswer the following questions using orthogonal contrasts:\n\nIs there a linear response of muscle growth to increasing whey protein?\nIs there a quadratic response of muscle growth to increasing whey protein?\nIs there a cubic response of muscle growth to increasing whey protein?\nDoes adding the creatine supplement have a significant effect on increase in muscle growth?\nIs the linear response to muscle growth different in the presence or absence of the creatine supplement?\nIs the quadratic response to muscle growth different in the presence or absence of the creatine supplement?\nIs the cubic response to muscle growth different in the presence or absence of the creatine supplement?\n\n(14 points)\n\n\nQ5(b)\nDemonstrate that the contrasts are orthogonal.\n(4 points)\n\n\nQ5(c)\nCreate a line plot that shows the average effect on muscle growth with increasing whey protein, both with and without supplement (i.e., 2 line plots - one for supplement, and one for no supplement). Based on the results of the plot which whey-protein-supplement combination will be the best for high muscle growth?\n(4 points)\n\n\nQ5(d)\nNow take the uncertainty of the estimates in the plot in 5(c) into account. Will your answer to the recommendation asked in 5(c) change? Why or why not?\nNote: If there are multiple combinations with no statistically significant difference in the muscle growth, and provide statistically significantly higher muscle growth than the rest of the combinations, then recommend the combination with the lower whey protein / supplement, as it will be cheaper.\n(4 points)",
